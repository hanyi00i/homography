# Homography Matrix

This is a simple implementation of the homography matrix in python and c++.
The python source code is in the file `phomo.py`. It is based on the [homography function](https://github.com/bilaer/Planar-homography/blob/master/Homography.py).

The homography function in the `phomo.py` is converted into `homopraphy.cpp` with c++ programming language.
